				<h1 style="text-align: left">What is Blockchain?</h1>
				<p>
					Blockchain technology is simply a clever way to get many different persons to create one common
					version of something when doing things on the internet. Single versions of things are important for
					uses like finding out if Ram paid Hari and only Hari for that Pen (and whether he didn’t copy his
					money and also pay someone else).
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h1 style="text-align: left">Why is it valuable?</h1>
				<p>
					Surprisingly in the pre-blockchain world, there was no way to get multiple persons to create
					something singular, and so we would usually have to put our trust in one person or representative
					(e.g. a bank) to create and maintain the singular versions of things we needed. Trusting one
					representative is costly as they can then charge us money to do things at prices that may not be
					fair. They can also manipulate the thing that we’ve entrusted them with to suit their whims and
					fancies, potentially in a way that hurts everyone else. This old way of doing things is also very
					inefficient since different groups of people would choose different representatives to maintain
					singular versions of the things important to them, making it very difficult to interact between
					groups.

				<p>
					When you send 100 Rs. to your friend in Hyderabad, paytm isn't literally putting a 100 Rs. on a
					plane. When you “received the money” it doesn’t mean there’s cash that got out of the plane and was
					just deposited into a metal box with your name on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					When somebody “trades stocks” the stock exchange isn't moving paper stock certificates and your bank
					isn't physically moving paper bills -- all they really are, are giant digital LEDGERS -- moving
					digital numbers around from one account to the other.
				</p>
				<p>
					So your money, stocks, even identity are just information in ledgers. Data. Does it really matter if
					a stock certificate is blue or green or 1 inch larger? The container of the data (colored pieces of
					paper, certificates) doesn’t matter. It’s what’s being contained that matters (value, ownership,
					identity) and those are things that exist in the mind. And those things are recorded in our record
					books.
				</p>
				<p>
					Traditionally, you had to have a central authority preside over a record book. How else would you do
					it? An accountant cannot give free access to his books. If everyone had full access to it, I’d just
					add 5 crores to my balance and retire (although someone else could then take it away from me).
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h1 style="text-align: left">Final Words</h1>
				<p>
					So we have institutions by necessity. The paytm ledger lives in a paytm computer. The bank ledger
					lives in a bank computer. That ledger is updated, secured and managed centrally. We trust these
					institutions to keep the integrity of the ledger. Now what happens when you have a magic ledger
					where there’s no central authority, but by some magic (== blockchain) we still know that the
					transactions have 100% integrity? Nobody can cheat the system.
