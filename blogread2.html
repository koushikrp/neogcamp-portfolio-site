				<h1 style="text-align: left">What is Blockchain?</h1>
				<p>
					Blockchain technology, in simple words, is an innovative way to get many different persons/investors
					to create one common version of something leveraging the power of internet. Single versions of
					things are important for uses like finding out if Ram paid Hari and only Hari for that Pen (and
					whether he didn’t copy his money and also pay someone else).
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h1 style="text-align: left">Why is it invaluable?</h1>
				<p>
					Actually before blockchain, there was no way to get multiple persons to create something in a unique
					way, and so we would usually have to put our trust in one person or a centralized entity (e.g. a
					bank) to create and maintain the unique versions of things we needed. Trusting one centralized
					organization is very costly as they can then charge us money to do things at prices that may not be
					fair. They can also manipulate the thing that we’ve trusted them with to suit their dreams and
					goals, potentially in a way that hurts everyone else. This old way of doing things is also very
					inefficient since different groups of people would choose different representatives to maintain
					unique versions of the things important to them, making it very hard to interact between different
					groups.
				</p>

				<p>
					When you send Rs.50 using Paytm to your friend in Hyderabad, Paytm isn't literally putting that
					Rs.50 on an airplane. When you <i>received</i> the money it doesn’t mean that the cash just came out
					in an airplane and was just deposited into a safe box with your name on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					When someone <strong>trades stocks using any software</strong>, the stock exchange is not using
					paper stock certificates for the transactions and your bank isn't physically moving paper
					bills/receipts. All they really are, are giant digital <strong>LEDGERS</strong> moving digital
					numbers(unique numbers) around from one account to the other in a secure way.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hence all your money, stocks and even identity are just information in ledgers i.e.
					<strong>Data</strong>. Does it really matter if a stock certificate is grey or red or 1 inch larger?
					The container of the data (like money certificates, bonds, other paper work) doesn’t matter. What
					matters is that, which is being contained. Value, Identity and Ownership are those are things that
					exist in the mind. And those things are recorded in our record books(offline ledgers).
				</p>
				<p>
					Conventionally, you would have had a central authority moderating a record book. In what other way
					would you do it? An accountant cannot freely share his books to everyone. If everyone had full
					access to it, I would just add 5 crores to my balance and retire (although someone else could then
					take it away from me).
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h1 style="text-align: left">Final Words</h1>
				<p>
					So we have presiding institutions(central entities) by necessity. The paytm ledger is stored in a
					paytm server and lives in the paytm network. The bank ledger lives in a bank computer in a remote
					location. That ledger is always updated, secured and perfectly managed centrally. We trust these
					organizations to keep the integrity of the ledger. Now when there is no central authority, by some
					magic technology (blockchain), we can still have 100%
					<strong>Integrity</strong>. Nobody can cheat the system. So, investing in such technology at the
					expense of changing the entire ecosystem seems to be a right choice. It may be slow pace now, but it
					will accelerate.
