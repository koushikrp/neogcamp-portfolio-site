				<h1>An AI powered Open Source Photo Editor for refining precise details</h1>

					Recent AI powered Photo Editors are making Photoshop redundant. You will be baffled by the Results
					Produced by these Computationally efficient Editors. One such Editor is
					<strong>SketchEdit: A Mask-Free Local Image Manipulator with Partial Sketches</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Take a look at the Sketch-based image manipulation elaborated in the Github Repository :
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zengxianyu/sketchedit">SketchEdit</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Different from other existing methods used in popular photo editors, that usually require users to
					draw an extra mask indicating the region to modify, this new paradigm of sketch-based image
					manipulation
					<strong
						>only requires sketch inputs from users, utilizes the entire original image and gives the
						result.</strong
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the Outputs:

				<div class="container container-center">
					<img src="/images/face_gif.gif" alt="Result is loading." width="400" />
				</div>
				<p>
					If we give an image and sketch, this Deep learning model automatically guesses the required target
					modification area and encodes it into a style vector which is formed in a structure independent way.
					Now the Generator creates the new content of the image based on the sketch and style vector. This
					manipulated image is finally produced by mixing the generator output into the modification area of
					the original image. This model is then trained in a supervised learning way by focusing the
					reconstruction of an image area from the sketch and style vector.

				Before few months, another approach was discovered, called LaMa, that can be used to remove various
				objects from pictures like Trees, Animals, People, Houses,Signs, other miniature details etc. The
				network then regenerates the background behind the deleted objects and achieves excellent accuracy and
				performance even in challenging scenarios. Ex: Completion of periodic structures.

				<p>
					AI-based software has certainly disrupted photo editing. But, this comes with both advantages and
					disadvantages. Such intelligent software can save enormous amount of time, but it can also
					negatively affect originality and imagination. Still, the best thing about most of todayâ€™s photo
					editing programs is that you can choose whether to use AI, depending on your preferences at any
					given time. So be active in trying out the latest software, and keep experimenting! Till we achieve
					Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this experimenting continues and we will keep producing
					astonishing results.
