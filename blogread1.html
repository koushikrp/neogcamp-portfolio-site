				<h1>An AI powered Open Source Photo Editor for refining precise details</h1>
				<small style="display: block; text-align: center">August, 2021</small>
				<p>
					Recent AI powered Photo Editors are making Photoshop redundant. You will be baffled by the Results
					Produced by these Computationally efficient Editors. One such Editor is
					<strong>SketchEdit: A Mask-Free Local Image Manipulator with Partial Sketches</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Take a look at the Sketch-based image manipulation elaborated in the Github Repository :
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zengxianyu/sketchedit">SketchEdit</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Unlike other existing methods that usually require users to draw an extra mask indicating the region
					to modify, this new paradigm of sketch-based image manipulation "only requires sketch inputs from
					users and utilizes the entire original image"
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the Outputs:
					<br />
				</p>
				<div class="container container-center">
					<img src="/images/face_gif.gif" alt="Result is loading." width="400" />
				</div>
				<p>
					"Given an image and sketch, our model automatically predicts the target modification region and
					encodes it into a structure agnostic style vector," states the team. "A generator then synthesizes
					the new image content based on the style vector and sketch. The manipulated image is finally
					produced by blending the generator output into the modification region of the original image. Our
					model can be trained in a self-supervised fashion by learning the reconstruction of an image region
					from the style vector and sketch."

				<h1 style="text-align: left">About Previous Approach</h1>
				Previously, another approach was discovered, called LaMa, that can be used to remove various objects
				from pictures like people, furniture, buildings, animals, not-needed details, etc. The network then
				recreates the background behind the deleted objects and achieves excellent performance even in
				challenging scenarios, e.g. completion of periodic structures.

				<p>
					AI-based software has certainly changed photo editing – though this comes with both advantages and
					disadvantages. Such software can definitely save time, but it can also negatively affect creativity.
					Still, the best thing about most of today’s photo editing programs is that you can choose whether to
					use AI, depending on your preferences at any given time. So feel free to try out some of the latest
					software, and don’t be afraid to experiment!
